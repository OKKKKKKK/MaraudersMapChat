Summer warmth masks coming storm
The Riddle House whispers with old fear
Dark shapes gather around Voldemort’s frail form
A killing curse falls in the night
The Quidditch World Cup shines with spectacle
Magic bursts in fireworks and cheers
But terror slithers beneath celebration
The Dark Mark scorches the sky
Old dread awakens in wizard hearts
Hogwarts greets foreign schools with grandeur
Durmstrang sails in with mystery
Beauxbatons glides with grace and charm
The Goblet flares blue with destiny
Names spit forth like prophecy
Harry’s appears against his will
Whispers coil around him like snakes
Ron’s envy carves space between brothers
Hermione stands torn between friends
Triwizard tasks loom with dread
Dragons roar fire at courage and fear alike
Harry faces flame and wins breathlessly
Mad-Eye's lessons twist survival into instinct
Ball gowns sparkle at the Yule Ball
Jealousy and awkward heartbeats fill winter air
Ron stumbles in pride and confusion
Hermione shines bright and strong
Love and youth collide in clumsy dances
The lake hides secrets beneath icy ripples
Harry saves not just his own but others
Honor blooms where rules fail
Rita Skeeter buzzes poison into the world
Friendships mend like healed glass
Spew dreams speak of justice and kindness
Bread crumbs of darkness scatter subtly
Third task rises, maze thick with whispers
Hedges pulse like breathing beasts
Champions fight shadows, spells, and doubt
Cedric shares victory with Harry
But glory curdles into nightmare
A Portkey whisks them to death’s domain
Graveyard soil tastes of dread
Voldemort rises out of ash and bone
Wormtail trembles beneath cruelty
A wand returns to a living monster
Dark robes appear like funeral smoke
Harry duels fate with shaking knees
Prior Incantatem binds past to present
Ghostly figures whisper love and courage
A father and mother guide him through terror
Cedric lies cold and silent
Harry returns broken and bleeding
The truth tears through denial
Dumbledore stands firm despite the storm
The Ministry turns blind in fear
Fudge chooses lies over courage
Hogwarts weeps for Cedric Diggory
A boy lost to arrogance and darkness
Harry feels grief like shattered glass
This year ends not in cheering but mourning
War’s first true breath fills the air
Friendship closes ranks around wounded hearts
The light dims but does not die
Storm clouds gather across magical skies
Hope flickers, thin but stubborn
The world shifts — childhood fades
A dark era begins without mercy
